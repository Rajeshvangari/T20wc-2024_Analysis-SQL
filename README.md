The 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the ninth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament. It was co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States from 1 to 29 June 2024, marking the second time the West Indies hosted the tournament and the first major ICC event to be held in the United States.

For the first time, the tournament field expanded from 16 to 20 teams, including the two hosts, the top eight teams from the 2022 edition, the best placed two teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings not already qualified, and eight other teams determined by regional qualifiers.

India emerged as the champions, defeating South Africa in the final by 7 runs. Virat Kohli was named the Player of the Match and Jasprit Bumrah clinched the Player of the Tournament award.

The tournament witnessed several historic moments, including Canada's first T20 World Cup victory, Afghanistan's first win against New Zealand in T20Is, and Bangladesh's first win against Sri Lanka in a T20 World Cup.
